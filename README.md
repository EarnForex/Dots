# Dots
Dots is a custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It was originally developed by *TrendLabotory*. It is a trend detector that displays its values in the form of colored dots (or circles) directly on the chart.

If configured properly, it can give rather accurate trend-changing signals with little lag. Unfortunately, there is no one size fits all settings that would work in all market conditions for this indicator.
